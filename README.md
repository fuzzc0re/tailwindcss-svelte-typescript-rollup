## Getting Started

To get started you need to:

- Use this template with your own GitHub profile
- Clone the repo
- npm i
- npm start

Everything just works.

## Features

This aims to be a batteries-included rollup setup.
The tsconfig enforces strict typescript rules in order to give a solid foundation for the projects that will use the
template.
The eslint config enforces the airbnb style guide and the prettier config helps with that. Only the ternary operators do
not adhere from time to time.
For routing the library svelte-spa-router is used.
